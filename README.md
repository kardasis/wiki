0x Protocol Wiki
----------------

Welcome to the 0x Protocol wiki!

This repo contains the raw markdown files that are rendered on the [wiki section](https://0xproject.com/wiki) of our website. Feel free to peruse the contents here and to submit PR's with typo fixes, logical corrections or extensions to the covered topics.

## Structure

- All wiki articles need to be within a top-level directory
- Nested directories are disallowed
- Article file names should be the title of the article with dashes (-) instead of spaces. Capitalization will be respected.
